BARTENDING DIY

Bartending DIY (Do It Yourself) wants to be a website that through a simple quiz, can be fun and at the sae time share some basic information in the mixoogy world.
The initial idea was to make a way longer quiz. After few consideration, I thought it would have been better to keep the quiz as short, generic and complete as possible.


USER EXPERIENCE

As first time visitor, the purpose was for the user to focus immediately in what the project was made for. 

The user can immediately start the quiz and perhaps use the internet for checking the answers.

There would be a score tracker, to keep track of the points, when the right answer would be selected.

For any returning visitor the goal would evenutally be to be more confident in taking the quiz again and get all the answers correctly.
