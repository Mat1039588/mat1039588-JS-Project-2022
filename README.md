BARTENDING DIY

Bartending DIY (Do It Yourself) wants to be a website that through a simple quiz, can be fun and at the sae time share some basic information in the mixoogy world.
The initial idea was to make a way longer quiz. After few consideration, I thought it would have been better to keep the quiz as short, generic and complete as possible.


USER EXPERIENCE

As first time visitor, the purpose was for the user to focus immediately in what the project was made for. 

The user can immediately start the quiz and perhaps use the internet for checking the answers.

There would be a score tracker, to keep track of the points, when the right answer would be selected.

For any returning visitor the goal would evenutally be to be more confident in taking the quiz again and get all the answers correctly.


CONTENT OF THE WEBSITE

The website presents a very simple structure. It contains 4 pages.

![Main Page](/IMG/main_screenshot.png)
![Quiz Page](/IMG/quiz_screenshot.png)
![Contact Page](/IMG/contact_screenshot.png)
![About Page](/IMG/about_screenshot.png)

- The fist page presents a very simple layout and it is of an immediate grasp. THe layout of the pages is consistent, they have a navbar and a footer in all of the pages.

- The quiz page presents a multi option answers and a script (jS) has been used to make it work. The user has to guess the right answer and the system will upload a score organised in hundreds. 
If the user fails to choose the right answer, the system will fail and go back to the homepage.

 - The contact page contains a form in a way that the user for any question or suggestions can send emails given that he/she provides their full name, email address.

- The about page is about who the developer is and requires some improvement.

HERE IS WHAT IT CAN BE IMPROVED

The webisite is very simple and can contain more features and be more interactive:

- The entire website could have more sections - the about and contact pages are present but maybe one or two more pages about maybe the best score and the possibility from the users to register and have them displayed on another page with a ranking page where the user can see who has been playing with the quiz and the total score.

- It would be good to have an about page more related to what the actual purpose of the website is.
- The contact page is missing personal information about address, email and phone number.
- The contact page to be used as a way for the useres to contact the developer suggesting new ideas. But that would have to be explained in the page.
